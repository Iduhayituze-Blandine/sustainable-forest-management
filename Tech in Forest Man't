Technology can aid forest management in different ways
1. We can have sensors in the forest to know the state of the trees in a certain period, what nutrients do they lack to grow well, are they having enough space for growth and so on. 
Through that we can easily supply nutrients to the forest and also cut some trees which are leading to overcrowding and limiting growth of some trees. 

2. Additionally, that can help us to know when to go hiking, as in when it is safe to go in the forest and what we can expect when we are there. 
It can also help us to know what nutrients trees contain and what we can use with them in terms of products like herbs and medecine.
